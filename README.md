**big_mac:** Get mac addresses with Rust, Neon, and JS

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

## Background

This project came about after exploring with Rust and Javascript, encountering a problem where the built in node.js code will only return to you the first interface that's _plugged in_ and not just _first in general_ I created this solution bridging rust to node.js using a handy little library known as neon, which will programatically generate bindings for your V8 runtime. 

## UIs

I've also included here two user interfaces to check out the work, test driving a newer version of electron as well as nodegui. Have fun!
